				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					Climate hazards are naturally occurring throughout the world in
					weather cycles. Natural disasters are normal and has been occurring
					since the world began. Droughts, floods, bushfires, hurricanes all
					start naturally however as of 2021 we are witnessing destruction
					beyond the natural means of the world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					In recent years especially after the industrial revolution there have
					been a series of devastating weather events. According to the
					<em>World Meteorological Organisation</em> the number of disasters has
					increased by a factor of five in half a century, further driven
					by<strong> climate change </strong>more and more extreme weather
					events are occurring and being reported. Although natural disasters
					have been happening the severity of these disasters are exponentially
					increasing due to climate change.
				</p>
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">
					How does climate change worsen natural disasters?
				</h2>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					According to the <em>United States Geological Survey (USGS)</em>, a
					government organisation that monitors, assess and conducts targeted
					science research. With the increasing global surface temperatures
					caused by <strong>climate change </strong>the possibility of more
					droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more
					water vapour is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes a fuel for
					more storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean
					surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical
					storms. This means that although the number of natural disasters
					remain constant the intensity and destructiveness of those are
					increasing.

					<p class="text-lg my-3">
						We have highlighted what happens when climate change affects our
						globe too widely but how did this happen? Our globe naturally goes
						through carbon absorbing phases where the carbon dioxide levels
						rises and gets absorbed by natural means, this can include trees,
						plants and other natural greens to help regulate CO2 levels. However
						since the industrial revolution when coal burning got introduced for
						manufacturing the world got introduced to carbon dioxide emissions
						like never seen before.

					<p class="text-lg my-3">
						Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and Earth's
						temperature by our daily activities; burning fossil fuels,
						deforestation and farming livestock.
