					Climate hazards are naturally occurring throughout the world in
					weather cycles. Natural disasters are normal and has been occurring
					since the world began. Droughts, floods, bushfires, hurricanes all
					start naturally however as of 2021 we are witnessing destruction
					beyond the natural means of the world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					In recent years especially after the industrial revolution there have
					been a series of devastating weather events. According to the
					<em>World Meteorological Organisation</em> the number of disasters has
					increased by a factor of five in half a century, further driven
					by<strong> climate change </strong>more and more extreme weather
					events are occurring and being reported. Although natural disasters
					have been happening the severity of these disasters are exponentially
					increasing due to climate change.
				</p>
				<h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 font-extrabold text-orange-300">
					How does climate change worsen natural disasters?
				</h2>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					According to the <em>United States Geological Survey (USGS)</em>, a
					government organisation that monitors, assess and conducts targeted
					science research. With the increasing global surface temperatures
					caused by <strong>climate change </strong>the possibility of more
					droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more
					water vapour is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes a fuel for
					more storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean
					surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical
					storms. This means that although the number of natural disasters
					remain constant the intensity and destructiveness of those are
					increasing.

						Climate change is defined as a significant change of average weather
						conditions for example getting warming, wetter or drier over
						decades. Although this does not impact us instantly it is the longer
						term trend that is concerning. Our globe naturally goes through
						carbon absorbing phases long before humans were around. This is
						where the carbon dioxide levels rises and gets absorbed by natural
						means, this can include trees, plants and other natural greens to
						help regulate CO2 levels. However since the industrial revolution
						when coal burning got introduced for manufacturing the world got
						introduced to carbon dioxide emissions like never seen before.

					<h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 font-extrabold text-orange-300">
						The main driver for climate change is the greenhouse effect.
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg my-3">
						As humans produce more and more greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous
						oxide and most prominently carbon dioxide) it creates an ozone layer
						that traps the natural heat produced by the sun. These heat waves
						are usually reflected back or absorbed naturally through photo
						synthesis and other natural processes of our plants and forests.
						However with the exponential continuous increase of green house
						gases during the industrial revolution the ozone layer has become so
						thick that heat from the sun is trapping heat within the atmosphere.
