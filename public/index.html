					Climate hazards are naturally occurring throughout the world in
					weather cycles. Natural disasters are normal and has been occurring
					since the world began. Droughts, floods, bushfires, hurricanes all
					start naturally. However as of 2021 we are witnessing destruction
					beyond the natural means of the world.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					In recent years especially after the industrial revolution, there have
					been a series of devastating weather events. According to the
					<em>World Meteorological Organisation</em> the number of disasters has
					increased by a factor of five in half a century, further driven
					by<strong> climate change </strong>more and more extreme weather
					events are occurring and being reported. Although natural disasters
					have been happening the severity of these disasters are exponentially
					increasing due to climate change.

				<h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 font-extrabold text-orange-300">
					How does climate change worsen natural disasters?
				</h2>
				<p class="text-lg my-3">
					According to the <em>United States Geological Survey (USGS)</em>, a
					government organisation that monitors, assesses, and conducts targeted
					science research, increasing global surface temperatures caused by
					<strong>climate change </strong> will also increase the possibility of
					more droughts and intensify storms. As more water vapour is evaporated
					into the atmosphere it becomes a fuel for more storms to develop. More
					heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead
					to increased wind speeds in tropical storms. This means that although
					the number of natural disasters remain constant, the intensity and
					destructiveness of those are increasing.

						Climate change is defined as a significant change of average weather
						conditions. This includes getting warmer, wetter, or drier weather
						over a number of decades. Although this does not impact us
						instantly, it is the longer term trend that is concerning. Our globe
						naturally goes through carbon absorbing phases long before humans
						were around. This is where the carbon dioxide levels rises and gets
						absorbed by natural means, which includes trees, plants and other
						natural greens to help regulate CO2 levels. However since the
						industrial revolution when coal burning got introduced for
						manufacturing, the world got introduced to carbon dioxide emissions
						that have never been seen before.

					<h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 font-extrabold text-orange-300">
						The main driver for climate change is the greenhouse effect.
					</h2>
					<p class="text-lg my-3">
						As humans produce more and more greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous
						oxide and most prominently carbon dioxide) it creates an ozone layer
						that traps the natural heat produced by the sun. These heat waves
						are usually reflected back or absorbed naturally through photo
						synthesis and other natural processes of our plants and forests.
						However with the exponential continuous increase of greenhouse gases
						during the industrial revolution, the ozone layer has become so
						thick that heat from the sun is trapping heat within the atmosphere.

							Countries all around the world are changing to be more climate
							conscious. Places such as Europe, Australia, and the United States
							are all exploring and diversifying their energy portfolio, some
							slower than others. There is no doubt that alternative meats, cars
							and energy are our future and in these 2 decades alone major
							contributions have been made. Although countries still heavily
							rely on coal, gas and oil as energy sources, the implementation of
							diversifying energy consumption in countries are significantly
							noticeable.

						<h2 class="text-3xl mt-6 font-extrabold text-lime-500">
							Not just corporations. Not just countries.
						</h2>
						<p class="text-lg py-3">
							Although large corporations and their sources of energy has made a
							significant change in lowering emissions, this positive future is
							largely attributed to individual efforts to be more deliberate in
							their sources of energy and consumption. Solar panels, electric
							vehicles and alternative meats are becoming mainstream which is
							one of the biggest changes in the past decade. Using renewable
							energy is a self conscious decision individuals can make to make
							an impact now. Collectively, as electric vehicles and solar panels
							become more affordable this fight against climate change seems
							more achievable. Entrepreneurs are still finding ways to
							re-imagine a green world and even ways to remove carbon emissions
							in the air.
